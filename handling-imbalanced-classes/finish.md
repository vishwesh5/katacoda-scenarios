# Well done!!

We have now reached the end of this scenario. Let's quickly summarize what we covered here:

1. Class imbalance and why it's important to deal with it
2. Different techniques for handling class imbalance
    - Specifying class weights
    - Downsampling the majority class
    - Upsampling the minority class
    - Pros and cons of each of the above techniques

I hope you had as much fun going through this as I had while creating this. Happy learning!
