# Python ML Cookbook: Handling Categorical Data

A lot of times it's not possible to assign a specific numerical value to a feature in a Machine Learning problem. Think about a COVID-19 patient database. It's not possible to give a decimal value like 0.6 for a patient's COVID-19 test result. It can be either "Positive" or "Negative", it can't be both!

In situations like the above, where only a set of distinct values can be assigned to a feature, we use the term "Categorical Feature" to refer to the specific feature. But, Machine Learning algorithms don't understand the words "Positive" or "Negative", they only understand numbers, so it becomes important to understand how to convert a category into a number. That's exactly what we will be going through in this scenario.

Let's get started!
