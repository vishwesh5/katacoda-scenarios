# Python ML Cookbook: Imputing Missing Class Values

We are not living in a perfect world, despite how much we wish we were. A complete and perfect data is usually a dream come true for any data scientist or ML engineer. Maybe someone didn't fill the data for a particular field or the data in itself got corrupted. Whatever the reasons might be, most Machine Learning algorithms are not meant to handle incomplete data. That's why, we need to treat the data before feeding it to the Machine Learning pipeline.

In this scenario, we will learn how to impute the missing values using two different approaches - replacing values by mode or by using a k-NN model to fill in the missing values.
