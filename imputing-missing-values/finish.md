# Job well done!!

Great to see you here at the finish line! In this scenario, we have gone through the following concepts:

1. Reasons behind missing values
2. Different ways of handling missing values
3. Using a kNN classifier for imputing missing values
4. Using Scikit-Learn's `Imputer` for imputing the missing values

I hope you enjoyed the scenario, happy learning!
